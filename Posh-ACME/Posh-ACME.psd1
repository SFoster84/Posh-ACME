* `Set-PAOrder` now has `-DnsPlugin` and `-PluginArgs` parameters to allow changing plugins and associated credentials prior to a renewal operation.
* Upgraded BouncyCastle library to version 1.8.5.2 and renamed the DLL to avoid conflicts with older copies that may get installed into the .NET GAC by other software.
* ACME server errors returned during calls to `Revoke-PAAuthorization` are now non-terminating errors rather than warnings.
* Fixed bug where new orders created with `New-PACertificate` and no explicit plugin wouldn't get the Manual default if the account was already authorized for the included names.
* Fixed `Get-PAAuthorizations` when using explicit account reference
* Fixed datetime parsing issues on non-US culture environments (#208)
* Fixed errors thrown by `Submit-Renewal` when run against an order with a null DnsPlugin. A warning is now thrown instead.
* Fixed parameter binding error when using `-PluginArgs` with `Submit-Renewal`
* Fixed HurricanElectric guide's parameter references
* Fixed Azure tests
